LLMs and AI Agents for Business

This repository contains materials, projects, and experiments developed during the course LLMs and AI Agents for Business, focused on the practical use of Large Language Models and AI agents in real-world business scenarios.

About this repository

The repository explores how modern LLMs and intelligent agents can be applied to solve concrete problems in companies, products, and services. The focus is on hands-on implementation, architectural decisions, and use cases aligned with current market demands, rather than purely theoretical concepts.

What was implemented

This repository contains implementations LLMs via APIs (free and paid) or locally using models such as Llama, DeepSeek, ChatGPT, and Gemini; build AI agents for content generation, RAG-based chatbots, resume analysis, financial insights, personalized recommendations, and SQL-based data analysis; and create professional interfaces for AI applications using Streamlit.
